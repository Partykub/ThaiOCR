# Project Cleanup Summary

## 🎯 Completed Cleanup Tasks

### ✅ Reorganized Structure
- ✅ Created modular `src/` directory with proper separation
- ✅ Moved models to dedicated `models/` directory  
- ✅ Organized scripts in `scripts/` directory
- ✅ Created `configs/` for configuration files
- ✅ Set up `logs/` for training outputs
- ✅ Moved documentation to `docs/`
- ✅ Archived old files in `archive/`

### ✅ Removed Unnecessary Files
- ✅ Deleted duplicate Python files
- ✅ Removed old model files (.h5)
- ✅ Cleaned up temporary files (.tmp, .bak)
- ✅ Removed simulation and test files
- ✅ Deleted empty directories

### ✅ Files Kept (Essential Only)
- ✅ `src/models/thai_crnn.py` - Clean model architecture
- ✅ `src/training/train_thai_crnn_clean.py` - Training script  
- ✅ `src/testing/test_thai_crnn_clean.py` - Testing script
- ✅ `models/thai_crnn_ctc_best.pth` - Best trained model
- ✅ `models/thai_char_map.json` - Character mapping
- ✅ `configs/model_config.json` - Model configuration
- ✅ `scripts/*.bat` - Convenient batch scripts
- ✅ `thai-letters/` - Dataset directory

### ✅ Updated Configuration
- ✅ Updated `.gitignore` for clean repository
- ✅ Created `requirements.txt` with essential dependencies
- ✅ Added comprehensive documentation

## 📊 Before vs After

**Before:** 
- 60+ mixed files in `build-model-th/`
- Duplicate and temporary files everywhere
- Unclear project structure
- Large repository with unnecessary files

**After:**
- Clean modular structure
- Only essential files kept
- Clear separation of concerns
- Optimized for development and deployment

## 🚀 Ready for Next Steps

The project is now clean, organized, and ready for:
- ✅ Model improvement and training
- ✅ Code maintenance and development  
- ✅ Documentation and collaboration
- ✅ Deployment and production use
